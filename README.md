# MZK Lord

I need to figure out if I still have the source code for this ... but this is a thing I made as a teenager. Weirdly - some bulletin boards are still around, and even more weirdly, they run LORD and this addon ...

This was an unreleased and (as far as I can recall) not fully completed version. In around 2003-2004, I was contacted by an enthusiast out of the blue who was looking for a solution to a Turbo Pascal Y2K bug that MZK Lord had. I dug up the old source code, patched my old Turbo Pascal, and recompiled the unreleased MZK Lord 6.0. So it's been out in the wild for years, and truth be told, I had to download it from the internet to put it into my own repo. I really hope I have the old source code, ghastly as it will be!

While searching for it, I tracked down an old blog post from some years back and copied it for posterity.

15 or so years ago (29 June 2010)
---

Some 15+ years ago, I was very heavily involved in the BBS scene. I absolutely loved it. My bulletin board, MZK BBS, was an awesomely ghastly ANSI based BBS that had 4 dial-in lines.

I say ghastly, because frankly all ANSI BBS' were ghastly, looking back now.

What got me into it was the community. The ability to bounce ideas off people, get feedback, figure things out. I was far more interested in running a site and figuring out how it ticked, and in sharing it with others, than in being just a regular user. So much so that I used part of a compensation settlement (from an accident as a child) to pay for my very own local area network, replete with multiple workstations, a shiny copy of Remote Access Pro 2.02, modems, rotary line - the works. I didn't realise at the time, but I was hacking my way into my future career.

I got heavily into the networking and development. I loved playing around with Novell DOS 7, which I'd adopted for its "Personal Netware" capabilities. It gave me the peer to peer network I needed, with a single central file share for running the BBS on all nodes. It turned out that this was a superb introduction to the full Novell Netware 2.x and 3.x, which I quickly jumped into when I started working.

Windows? We were talking 3.1 at the time. Not a workable solution for a BBS, and in fact even Windows 95, when it eventually came along, wasn't going to cut it. No, it was all DOS.

What really nailed the BBS scene for me was Echomail. You named it, I signed up for it. Fidonet, Worldnet, Adultnet ... god, I can't even remember all of them. I had a Fidonet node, my netmail address ... my first introduction to Internet email too, through the UUCP gateway. It opened up a world of community for me, and my users loved it too.

Echomail made it so easy for me to learn about new downloads - many a night spent downloading the latest game demos for my users, on international dialups. I would get the latest and greatest doors and addins for the site, and happily get them up and running. Our first door was Legend of the Red Dragon, LORD, which was registered by our awesome users.

I started to learn about developing for bulletin boards. I think my first addin was a tagline generator, called MZKTag. The first version just selected from a text file of quotes, formatted it, and added it to the file that most text editors looked for at the time. Seeking for a random line could be quite slow though, so the next version implemented 'compiling' the text file into a rudimentary database, making selection instantaneous.

I remember releasing my first addin publicly and seeing it get downloaded and used by others. What a rush! I was hooked. It didn't take long for me to get into creating doors proper. I had a Who's Online door, developed a Terminator knockoff door .. so many others I can't remember!

I gave up sleep. It affected my schoolwork while I was there, but ironically that wasn't such a big deal for my future career! I got addicted to chatting with my users. Even when I did sleep, I'd often be raised at 3 or 4am by the dulcet tones of "Sweet Child o' Mine" - my sysop page - to chat. Awesome.

Eventually I got into adding onto Legend of the Red Dragon (LORD). The author, Seth Able Robinson, had kindly provided some file structures for his door. Another developer had created an NPC extension for LORD, which interested me but which seemed limited. So I set out to create my own; in some cases using the file structures, in others reverse engineering them.

My addon, MZK Lord, implemented NPC's in a weird and wonderful way. It simulated a number of players - my NPC's - signing in each night and playing, essentially replicating all of the game. I made it update the daily news with those actions. But that wasn't enough. I went further - especially as new versions of LORD came out with new features and abilities. I added a "STOP PRESS!" feature which brightened up the daily news. I added ridiculous fairies in the forest garden. I made NPC's make comments anywhere there was a bulletin board in the game, and even send mail. Hell, I even got my NPC's to engage in "romance" as part of the game features, figuring out Seth's mail codes to leverage them into my addon.

Things got very exciting. I had people from all over the world dialing up to download MZK Lord. I started work on an epic update - v6.0 - which would make all the hardcoded comments and names into editable ones. Among other additions, which were so vast it became an epic development. I nearly finished it, too.

And then ...

Nothing. I lost my enthusiasm and excitement for the BBS. I stopped wanting to develop for the game. I had a bad run at work and with a couple of users, but realistically I think work took over as my passion. The work of love that built my career had to go. It took days to make the decision, but ultimately MZK went off the air.

Since then, I've gone on to bigger and better things. I've done other sites - one of which suffered a similar fate - and I've grown and developed into an IT professional with broad experience and knowledge. I do look fondly back on those days, but I see why things had to move.
